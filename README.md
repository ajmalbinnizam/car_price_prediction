A second hand car price prediction has been a high-interest research area, as it requires
noticeable effort and knowledge of the field expert. Considerable numbers of distinct
attributes are examined for reliable and accurate prediction. The data used for the
prediction was collected from the kaggle.com
In our project we will build a model for predicting the price of used cars in India, by
applying several machine learning techniques and Respective performances of different
algorithms were then compared to find one that best suits the available data set, the final
prediction model will be integrated with a flask app where the user can input attributes like
their budget, model of the car, age of the car etc., in a responsive layout and hosting it in
heroku.com. Furthermore, the model will evaluate using test data and shows the output as
the amount of money required to purchase the used car
